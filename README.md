## Introduction

UCAD is a novel Unsupervised Continual AD framework and we augment it with SAM.

## Code

Due to patent application and code review, the code will be made public later (Maybe February, 2024). If you need UCAD code for reference, please contact my email <liujq32021@mail.sustech.edu.cn>.
